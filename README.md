# homePage
My custom Home page. <br>
Its a personal project i always wanted a custom home page for my web browser, <br>
and it takes me a long time to do it, doing this project i have learned a bit more of javaScript using the <br>
Time and date, was really satisfying.<br>
The technologies i have used was:<br>
* JavaScript for the date and time <br>
* Html for the structure<br>
* CSS Flexbox for the responsive side of the website for screen resolutions of 1280Ã—728 and 1920x1080.<br>
